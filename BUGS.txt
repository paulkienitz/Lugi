        NOT IMPLEMENTED YET:

Hmmm, maybe "kill with", which users are sure to try (later... try to avoid this -- it's not in the spirit).

Add "drink from flask/can".

Add "...plug out" and "...out plug"?  Add "pull plug"?

It would be nice to add "look in bag" or other container, especially if it's not held.

(top ten will need antitampering security if done over web... encrypt locally too?
eventually, detailed record of game with random seed, all score details, and verifiable hash (let's not have complete command log?))

(Add "spraycans" distinct from "cans"?  *NO*, let's say cans always means spraycans, not all four cans.)

Maybe check biguation of "cans of lysol and flysol"?


        GAMEPLAY BUGS:

...Leaving this unfixed: Climb down rope msg should be checked after no way through check.

(TEST new optional 'it'-clearing behavior... later.
 ..."I don't see any nothing here" probably occurs on multiple verbs besides take.)

(Maybe just change the acetone can to a plastic jug?  That shifts the biguation trouble to "bottle", but it's simpler that way.  Try this with an ifdef?)

********************  COULD NOT REPLICATE -- may have been fixed by AskCommand update, but those fixes don't explain this:
Said "ct urine" in niche, and AskCommand > Understand said array out of bounds on dictionary[firstletter].

******************** ARRGH hole in floor of cistern!  Gorilla ended up in there??  That should also be impossible.
Test harness COULD NOT REPLICATE.  What could open hole later?  Can't have been nitro, right?  Not with gorilla there.

(is it bogus for 'all' to not set 'it' as gleeps when they're included?  defensible, I guess)


        CODE ISSUES:

(We can further generalize spillage.)

(We could have a universal thingy for checking whether object A can be moved from place B to place C, as a way to unify take and put code.)

For amiga ctrl-C during input waits for enter key.  Bug of Aztec fgets may be unfixable without c.lib source?
For watcom msdos ctrl-C does not exit the program at all, or maybe that's MS-DOS Player's fault.  Try dosbox?
